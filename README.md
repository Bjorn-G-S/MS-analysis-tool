## General

`MS_Analysiss` is a python script  used for analyzing and quantifying results experiments done in the Methane To Methanol reaction (MTM). It takes raw ASCII-type files from a MID MassSpectrometer, integrates the peaks, and calculates the yield, selectivity and productivity of the reaction based on information of the catalyst. The return data is given back as a Excell table and saved on desired file path. Currently `MS_Analysiss` is used at the section for catalysis at the University of Oslo.

## Purpose

Analyze and visualize data from MS measurments taken during MTM experiments Cu-zeolites.


## How-to
How to use the program.


1. Import the program:
```
From MS-class import MS_analysis_MTM
```
2. Define the directory of the files that are to be converted and the file with the x-vlaues:
```
obj = MS_analysis_MTM()
```
3. Run the program. the following message will the apear:
```
                   THIS CLASS IS USED FOR ANALYZING EXPERIMENTS (MS AND TEMPERATURE DATA) TAKEN AT THE M2M-rig 
                                              use the following commands in the MS_analysis:



        obj.help()                    -        Will give this list over commands, and what their function is.



        
                                               Methane to Methanol experiments:  



        obj.plot_MS()                 -        Old script for analyzing MS data from a MTM catalytic test
        
        obj.plot_MS_Area()            -        Defining the Area for the MS masses

        obj.Area_to_csv()             -        Used to convert the area peaks to .csv so that it can by analyzed outside the script. 
        
        obj.testing_resutls()         -        When Area is defined form obj.plot_MS_Area, this will do the calcualtion to get the yield, selectivity etc.
```
**** Please note that the file paths need to be changed to the desired filepaths before using the program ****
